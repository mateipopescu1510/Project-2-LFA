# Project-2-LFA
__Changes from the first project:__
* instead of a list, the graph/FA is now a dictionary of the form:
* {state: [bool, (nextNode1, letter), (nextNode2, letter), ...]}
* cleaner constructor for the graph
* lambda closure method for a state 
* conversion to DFA
* updated method for accepting words
